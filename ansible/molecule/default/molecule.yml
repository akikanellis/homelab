# We currently use a 4-core ubuntu-latest instance in the
# '.github/workflows/test.yml' workflow. After performance testing the runners
# with different platform core and memory allocations, we found that 2-core
# platforms with 2GB of memory were the optimal configurations for test
# runtime. Higher core counts were slower, most likely due to inefficient
# virtualisation in GitHub Action runners, which led to increased resource
# contention and I/O overhead.
