## About

This policy outlines the procedure for reporting vulnerabilities for this
project to ensure the protection of sensitive information and maintain the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there are any vulnerabilities in the project, don't hesitate to
_report them_.

1. Please email [hello@akikanellis.com](mailto:hello@akikanellis.com).
2. Describe the vulnerability, the steps you took to create the issue, the
    affected versions, and, if known, how to mitigate the problem.

    If you have a fix, that is most welcome -- please attach or summarize it in
    your message!

3. We will evaluate the vulnerability and, if necessary, release a fix or
    mitigating steps to address it. We will contact you to let you know the
    outcome and credit you in the report.

    Please **do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until a fix is
    released!

4. Once we have either (a) published a fix or (b) declined to address the
    vulnerability, you are free to disclose it publicly.
